<div class = "paragraph">This was just another quiet house in the quiet neighborhood of Powhatan. It was about this time of year that you’d be seeing Jack o’ Lanterns, ghosts and ghouls lined up around the block. Orange lights strung across branches and cobwebs hung from rooftops and windowsills. Children ran through the streets on Halloween, parading from house to house. When they reached the house on 2019 Powhatan Street, they would be greeted with a smile. The owner would open the door and beckon them inside, as the scent of pumpkin pie wafted out to greet them. That night, after the children had taken off their costumes, and piled and counted and eaten their fill of sweets, several parents would notice that their sons and daughters had not returned. That night as the sleep came over the quiet town of Powhatan, several of the distraught parents gathered to search the woods for the lost children. A few days later, the police would open the doors to the empty house on Powhatan Street, to investigate a biting stench emerging from the basement.
<br><br>
The events that occurred that Halloween would be etched within the walls of the house forever. No one has lived there since, but the house remains the same as it was 10 years ago, on the night of the Powhatan Halloween Massacre. 
<br><br>
You’ve come to the address with your daring friends on the anniversary of the brutal Powhatan Street murders. A night when lost spirits roam the grounds, wanting to be put to rest. Perhaps you can help them find their peace. But beware, something evil lingers on the air as you approach….
