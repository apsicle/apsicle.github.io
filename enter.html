  <div class="paragraph">
    This was just another quiet house in the quiet neighborhood of Powhatan. It was about
    this time of year that you&rsquo;d be seeing Jack o&rsquo; Lanterns, ghosts and
    ghouls lined up around the block. Orange lights strung across branches and cobwebs
    hung from rooftops and windowsills. Children ran through the streets on Halloween,
    parading from house to house. When they reached the house on 2019 Powhatan Street,
    they would be greeted with a smile. The owner would open the door and beckon them
    inside, as the scent of pumpkin pie wafted out to greet them. That night, after the
    children had taken off their costumes, and piled and counted and eaten their fill of
    sweets, several parents would notice that their sons and daughters had not returned.
    That night as the sleep came over the quiet town of Powhatan, several of the
    distraught parents gathered to search the woods for the lost children. A few days
    later, the police would open the doors to the empty house on Powhatan Street, to
    investigate a biting stench emerging from the basement.<br />
    <br />
    The events that occurred that Halloween would be etched within the walls of the house
    forever. No one has lived there since, but the house remains the same as it was 10
    years ago, on the night of the Powhatan Halloween Massacre.<br />
    <br />
    You&rsquo;ve come to the address with your daring friends on the anniversary of the
    brutal Powhatan Street murders. A night when lost spirits roam the grounds, wanting
    to be put to rest. Perhaps you can help them find their peace. But beware, something
    evil lingers in the air as you approach&hellip;.
